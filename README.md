# AngularBlog

Angular Blog is a personal project developed to explore and demonstrate key concepts of Angular development. Built using Angular CLI version 19.2.9, the application serves as a foundational blogging platform, showcasing essential features such as component-based architecture, routing, and reactive forms.

Key Features
	•	Component-Based Architecture: Utilizes Angular’s component-driven structure to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
	•	Routing: Implements Angular Router for seamless navigation between different views and components.
	•	Reactive Forms: Employs reactive forms to handle user input and form validations efficiently.
	•	Responsive Design: Designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
	•	Development Tools: Leverages Angular CLI for code scaffolding, building, and serving the application during development.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
